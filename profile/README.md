## ðŸ‘‹Â  Introduction

Hello, We're Team I'm Hero.

We recently developed an environmental challenge community app. 

Now is the time when various environmental activities like plogging and reducing the use of disposable items are gaining more awareness and being practiced. However, is there a way to increase participation and make protecting the environment even more enjoyable? That's why we created this app to collaborate with friends, especially those living in our local communities, to make our surroundings cleaner and more pleasant. With this app, you can also share what you've done with your friends through social media.

Also, use the water droplets (points) you earn from environmental protection activities to grow and collect flowers of various colors! By doing so, you'll eventually become a hero of the Earth.
